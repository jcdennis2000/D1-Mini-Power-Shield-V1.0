# D1-Mini-Power-Shield-V1.0

The D1 Mini is a great little Arduino compatable board with built in WiFi that means it can be placed almost anywhere! The only problem is that powering the device from far away can be hard, as the D1 Mini only takes 5V or 3.3V. 
Never fear! You can now use the D1 Mini Power Shield to supply 9-12V to your D1 Mini! It has a voltage regulator, two capacitors, a power LED, and supplies a regulated 5V current directly into the 5V pin on the D1 Mini
